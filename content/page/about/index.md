I grew up in Malta, a little island in the Mediterranean Sea south of Sicily and north of Libya, where I studied for and was awarded a degree in Mathematics and Physics, and a diploma in Software Engineering. I worked as a quantum information scientist for a year during my master's degree, and I have been a hobbyist programmer for as long as I can remember.
