## Boring biographical stuff
I grew up in Malta, a little island in the Mediterranean Sea south of Sicily and north of Libya. I have a degree in Mathematics and Physics, and a diploma in Software Engineering. I have worked as a quantum information scientist for a year during my master's degree, and I have been a hobbyist programmer for as long as I can remember.

## Interests
Ok, so, with that out of the way, onto the (hopefully) cool stuff! ðŸ˜€

### Physics

### Mathematics

### Programming

### Art

### Not LLMS
Fine, the title is a bit of a lie. AI is a fascinating field, and it has clearly made a lot of demonstrable progress in recent years, the most visible of which by far is large language models. However, I don't really care for them. I'm more interested in AI in so far as it relates to optimization, control theory, and robotics. I enjoy reading and studying algorithms which solve problems with a high degree of specificity, and I find modularity sort of aesthetically beautiful. Large language models are (mostly) black boxes and, in so far as a problem can be expressed as "generate optimal strings of text", they are a solution, but I don't find that expression interesting.

Anyway, here is what I *do* find interesting.

#### Optimization
#### Control Theory
#### Robotics
